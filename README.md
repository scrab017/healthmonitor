# Brookings India Health Monitor

The Brookings India Health Monitor brings together real time data, research & powerful analytics of India’s healthcare sector on a common platform. It’s created using publicly available data from across all states & Union Territories. It enables researchers & policy makers to access, monitor and analyse real time health measures at a highly disaggregated level.

This Health Monitor is the brainchild of Shamika Ravi (Senior Fellow, Brookings India), Mudit Kapoor (Indian Statistical Institute) and a team of research and administrative collaborators from across the country. The detailed methodology outlining variables and computation is explained here. The portal also provides latest research in healthcare from Brookings India and Brookings Institution that is of relevance to India. This is an evolving platform and we welcome you to join the effort.
